This pidgeon is one of the original pigeon's added to the store by our founders and it represents the truth that things don't always have to appear as they seem. And they sometimes there might even be a pidgeon hidden in plain sight ;).",

Even if he wasn't pufing up his chest he would still be very tall! But with his chest puffed out he looks very manly ;) I really like the bluey greeny part of his chest where he puffed it up, it makes him look like he's wearing a coat a bit!",

Quite a magnificent sight, these glorious birds have decided to take our lord satan as their lord and savior... Just kidding ;). As should be quite obvious this is merely the result of a prank played by some local kids drawing out pentegrams in chalk on a street, then playfully some birdseed or breadcrumbs in the middle to attract these pidgeons. And quite the number there are! i'm sure they got more than they bargined for ;).",

I mean this one is definatly a joke but sometimes people get really attached to things and what if someone really wanted to find a pigeon and posted an ad online, would they be able to find it? Probably not.",
